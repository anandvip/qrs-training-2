        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Questions and Answers</h2>
            <p class="question">1. What is PEMF therapy?</p>
            <p class="answer">PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) therapy is a non-invasive treatment that uses electromagnetic fields to stimulate cellular repair and improve overall health.</p>

            <p class="question">2. How does PEMF therapy work?</p>
            <p class="answer">PEMF therapy works by generating pulsed electromagnetic fields that penetrate the body, stimulating cellular metabolism, improving circulation, and enhancing the body's natural healing processes.</p>

            <p class="question">3. What conditions can PEMF therapy help with?</p>
            <p class="answer">PEMF therapy has shown benefits for various conditions including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chronic pain</li>
                    <li>Inflammation</li>
                    <li>Bone healing and osteoporosis</li>
                    <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
                    <li>Insomnia</li>
                    <li>Wound healing</li>
                    <li>Cardiovascular health</li>
                    <li>Neurological disorders</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="question">4. Is PEMF therapy FDA approved?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes, PEMF therapy devices have FDA approval for certain applications like bone healing and depression treatment.</p>

            <p class="question">5. Are there any side effects of PEMF therapy?</p>
            <p class="answer">PEMF therapy is generally considered safe with few side effects. Some people may experience mild temporary discomfort during treatment.</p>

            <p class="question">6. How long does a typical PEMF therapy session last?</p>
            <p class="answer">Sessions typically range from 15-30 minutes, but can vary based on the specific device and condition being treated.</p>

            <p class="question">7. How many sessions are needed to see results?</p>
            <p class="answer">The number of sessions varies depending on the condition, but many people report improvements within 5-10 sessions. Chronic conditions may require ongoing maintenance treatments.</p>

            <h2>Objection Handling</h2>

            <div class="objection">
                <strong>Objection:</strong> "PEMF therapy sounds like pseudoscience. Where's the real evidence it works?"
            </div>
            <div class="response">
                <strong>Response:</strong> I understand your skepticism. PEMF therapy actually has decades of scientific research behind it, including numerous peer-reviewed studies. For example, a study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research showed PEMF therapy significantly improved bone healing. NASA has even used PEMF to prevent bone and muscle loss in astronauts. I'd be happy to provide you with more specific research relevant to your interests.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Technical terms used:</strong> Peer-reviewed studies, NASA research
                <br>
                <strong>Understanding:</strong> Address the concern about scientific validity by citing specific, credible research examples.

            <div class="objection">
                <strong>Objection:</strong> "This seems expensive. Why should I choose PEMF over other treatments?"
            </div>
            <div class="response">
                <strong>Response:</strong> I appreciate your concern about cost. While PEMF therapy does require an initial investment, many patients find it more cost-effective in the long run compared to ongoing medication or other treatments. PEMF addresses root causes at the cellular level, potentially reducing the need for other interventions. Additionally, a single device can be used to treat multiple conditions, providing more value. We also offer financing options to make it more accessible. Would you like to see a cost comparison for your specific situation?
                <br><br>
                <strong>Technical terms used:</strong> Cellular level intervention
                <br>
                <strong>Understanding:</strong> Highlight the long-term value and multi-use nature of PEMF to justify the cost.
            </div>

            <div class="objection">
                <strong>Objection:</strong> "I'm worried about potential side effects or interactions with my current medications."
            </div>
            <div class="response">
                <strong>Response:</strong> Your concern for safety is completely valid. PEMF therapy is generally considered very safe with minimal side effects. Unlike many medications, it doesn't introduce any chemicals into your body - it simply stimulates your body's natural healing processes. However, I always recommend consulting with your doctor, especially if you have any implanted electrical devices like pacemakers. We can provide you with safety information to discuss with your healthcare provider. Would you like me to send you our detailed safety guide?

                <br>
                <strong>Understanding:</strong> Address safety concerns by emphasizing the non-invasive nature of PEMF and encouraging consultation with a doctor.
